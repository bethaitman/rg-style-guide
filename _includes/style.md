#The Redgate writing style guide

This guide contains advice about how to write and format anything read by people outside the company, including documentation, marketing copy, surveys, emails, and error messages.

Note that this style guide contradicts lots of our existing writing, because things have changed since then, or because there was no fixed style at the time, or someone was drunk.

##The short version

* Use plain English.

* Delete every word you don't need.

* Use American English, unless you're writing for the British market.

* Use capital letters cautiously; You Don't Need To Capitalize Everything Like This. The same applies for buttons, headings, menus, email topics, and job titles.

* Use contractions (eg it's, isn't, hasn't etc).

* Spell internet with a small i.

##Tone

The [gov.uk style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) says: "Write conversationally – picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-to-one but with the authority of someone who can actively help."

Gov.uk aims its content to be:

* informative

* clear and concise

* brisk but not terse

* incisive (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary words) – but human (not a faceless machine)

* serious but not pompous

We should aim for the same.
