##Principles

* Use plain English.

* Delete every word you don't need.

* Use American English, unless you're writing for the British market.

* Use capital letters cautiously; You Don't Need To Capitalize Everything Like This. The same applies for buttons, headings, menus, email topics, and job titles.

* Use contractions (eg it's, isn't, hasn't etc).

* Spell internet with a small i.

##Tone

The [gov.uk style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) says: "Write conversationally – picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-to-one but with the authority of someone who can actively help."

Gov.uk aims its content to be:

* informative

* clear and concise

* brisk but not terse

* incisive (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary words) – but human (not a faceless machine)

* serious but not pompous

We should aim for the same.

This guide is far from comprehensive. Where something isn't covered here, see:

* the [Guardian style guide](http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a) for sensible guidelines on all sorts of writing matters (but remember we use American English)
* the [gov.uk style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) for nice advice about writing plain English (but remember, again, that we use American English)
* the [Microsoft Manual of Style (fourth edition PDF)](https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780735648715/samplepages/9780735648715.pdf) for software-specific terminology. There are physical copies in the office if you'd like one. Be aware some of it's out of date, particularly when it comes to capitalization
