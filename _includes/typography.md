[\< Style](style.html)

# Typography

This page should include:

* the font(s) we use, and where
* heading sizes/proportions, and where to use which heading styles
* line height/spacing
* colouring, if there is anything

Mention that this will be in the default Honeycomb CSS, so if you've referenced the Honeycomb Sass file, you'll get these styles applied to your text and headings without needing to do anything.
