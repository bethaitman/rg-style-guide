# Headers

The top bar in all Redgate applications.

Need to work out the different versions of the header, then include:

* where to use which header
* what they look like (including colouring and spacing, what selected sections look like, etc)
* what content needs to be in header
* iconography
* for web projects, the css classes needed for that styling (using example html)
