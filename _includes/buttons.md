# Buttons

This page should show all the major button styles, for example, a primary call-to-action button.

For every style, include:

* what they look like (an image, plus descriptions of colours, padding, etc)
* when you'd use them
* any interactions around them (eg what happens when they're clicked)
* how to write for them (eg label should be an action)
* if it's a web project, the css classes needed for that styling

Need to think about how to help non-web projects use them.
